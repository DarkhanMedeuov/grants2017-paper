# grants2017-paper

Hi, this is a replication package for the paper "Negotiating Science Funding", which is forthcoming in PLOS One. Later I will add a link to the paper. Script numbers indicate the order. Scripts 01â€“04 were not uploaded because they deal with PIs' names.

The name grants2017 is somewhat misleading, as it gives the impression that the paper is from 2017. The paper is fresh and will be published (I hope) relatively soon. 2017 refers to the year the grant competition took place. I wish I could come up with a better name for the repo, but anyway.

Cheers.
