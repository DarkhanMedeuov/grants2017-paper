# grants2017-paper

Hi, this is a replication package for the paper "Negotiating Science Funding" which is forthcoming in PLOS One. Later I will add a link to the paper. Scripts' number tells the order. Scripts `01-04` were not uploaded because they deal with PI's names.

The name `grants2017` is somewhat misleading as it gives an impression that the paper is of 2017. The paper is fresh and will be published (I hope) relatively soon. 2017 refers to the year the grant competition took place. I wish I could come up with a better name for the repo, but anyway. 

Cheers.
